      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a computer science student at BYU Idaho. I love programming and working on cars. I
        love web design and I am excited to learn how to apply it in a world that is increasingly dependent on
        technology!</p>

        python and uses the imaplib library to connect to the email server and the cups library to print the emails. It
        is a fun project that I made solve a real life problem! Link coming soon!</p>
