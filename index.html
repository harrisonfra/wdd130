  <p>My name is Harrison and I am a computer science student at BYU Idaho. I love programming and working on cars. I love web design and I am excited to learn how to apply it in a world that is increasingly dependent on technology!</p>
  <p>I have been a member of the church for my whole life. I served in the Utah, Salt Lake City mission and learned to speak Swahili there. My favorite scripture is Doctrine and Covenants 133:37 "And this gospel shall be preached unto every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people."</p>
